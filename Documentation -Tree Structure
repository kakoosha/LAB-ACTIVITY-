Q.Introduced what is it?

Answer: This program is a simple application for building and displaying a tree-like data structure.  It uses a  TreeNode  class to represent nodes in the tree, where each node can have multiple children.  The application allows the user to interact add nodes to the tree by specifying a parent node and a child node.  Finally, it displays the resulting tree structure in a hierarchical format on the console.

Q.Describe what it can do ?

Answer: The code adds the new child node to the specified parent.  The current implementation simplifies this by always adding new children to the root node; a more version would search the tree for the correct parent node before adding the child.

Q.Answer why did you make that kind of application and How does it contribute to you or to the community?

Answer: I create  this code to demonstrate a fundamental computer science concept: tree data structures.  Tree structures are used many applications, from file systems and decision trees to representing hierarchical data  and organizing elements in user interfaces.  Building this application helps connects my understanding of these structures and how they are implemented in ways.

 

While this  application might not have a direct impact on the community, it serves as a valuable learning tool.  It can be used by students or anyone learning about data structures to understand how trees work, how to implement them in code, and how to visualize their structure.  The simplicity of the application makes it easier to grasp the core concepts without being stress in  complexity.  In essence, itâ€™s a contribution to educational resources for those learning programming and data structures.
